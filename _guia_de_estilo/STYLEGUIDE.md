# Style Guide for Grupo de Ecología y Conservación de Islas

## Commit Messages

The following guidelines define how to write effective commit messages.

- Start with an emoji from the Gitmoji standard to indicate the type of change.
- Follow the emoji with an imperative verb (e.g., “Add”, “Fix”, “Refactor”).
- Describe **why** the change was made, not just **what** was changed.
- Prioritize explaining **why** over **what**.
- Limit each line to ≤ 80 characters.
- The first line must be a complete sentence and act as a summary.
- Separate the summary from the body with a blank line.
- The body should consist of well-formed paragraphs.
- The message length is unrestricted if needed for clarity.
- Prefer many small commits over few large ones.

---

## Repository Content Rules

- Only plain text files may be committed (`csv`, `json`, `svg`, `tex`, `txt`, etc.).
- Binary files are not allowed, except under strict conditions (see below).
- Files must not exceed 1 MB or ~10,000 lines of code.
- Prefer `svg` over any binary image format.
- Binary images are allowed only if:
  - They are required for application functionality, and
  - Their largest dimension is ≤ 256 pixels.
- Any exception must be explicitly agreed upon.

---

## Repository Structure (Class 3)

This structure is required for Class 3 repositories.
There is currently no defined standard for other repository classes.

The structure is inspired by Cookiecutter Data Science.
Changes must be validated against that reference to avoid contradictions.

## Project Core Configuration

### Makefile
The `Makefile` must contain three sections:
1. **`all` phony target**: Lists all primary outputs defined in `analyses.json`.
2. **Per-result blocks**: Variable declarations, rules for main targets, rules for dependencies, and phony rules for dependencies.
3. **General-purpose phony rules**.

### README.md
- Acts as the authoritative description of required work.
- Must define expected outputs clearly and completely.
- Contains an ordered list of the expected project outputs.

### analyses.json
- Describes the relationships between files (data, reports, results, scripts, etc.) of each analysis.

---

## Project Components

### Data
- Follow the structure defined in `data/`.
- **Raw data** must remain immutable.
- **Processed data** is shaped for analysis and includes intermediate results.
- Intermediate results belong in `data/processed/` or `reports/`.
- Data acquisition procedures must be documented.

### Reports
- Target audience: project director.
- Source formats: LaTeX or Markdown (Plain text preferred for version control).
- Output format: PDF (Word only if explicitly required).

### References
- Store in `references/`.
- Include `references.bib` (BibTeX) and `references.md` (annotated list with links).
- All cited materials must be included here.

### Tests
- Located in `tests/`.
- Must verify reproducibility of results.
- Test file names must follow the naming rules of the framework. If allowed:
    - Start with prefix `test_` (e.g., `test_plot_island`).
    - Only letters and numbers allowed (no ñ or accented vowels).

---

## Coding Standards

### Language Requirements
- **Code Language**: R (Tidyverse style).
- **Commentary Language**: Spanish (Focus on **why** - logic/reasoning - rather than what).
- **Variable/Function Names**: English.

### Source Code Structure (`src/`)
- All scripts must reside in `src/`.
- Structure scripts into five specific sections: Header, Configuration, Inputs, Process/Analysis, and Output.

#### 1. Header Section (Comment Block)
Use EXACTLY this structure with the opening and closing separators. Always include ALL sections (even if minimal) and never change section order:

```r

# ==========================================
# Título: (1 línea)
# 
# Contexto (Por qué): (2–4 líneas)
# 
# Descripción (Qué / Cómo): (3–6 líneas)
# 
# Entradas: (Sin bullets, uno por línea, incluir capa si aplica: `(capa: "nombre")`)
#   *Example*: data/processed/file.gpkg (capa: "layer_name")
# 
# Salidas: (Sin bullets, uno por línea)
# 
# Dependencias: (Un paquete por línea, sin comas)
#   *Example*: sf
#             tidyverse
# 
# Notas: (Opcional, máximo 4 bullets. Use bullet points ONLY in this section)
# ==========================================

**Consistency Rules for Header:**
- Use ONLY Spanish (keep technical function names in English, e.g., `st_bbox()`, `ggplot2`).
- Never mix English and Spanish section names.
- Always write in third person ("El script carga...", "El script calcula...").
- Do NOT use infinitive form (avoid: "Cargar").
- Keep sentences short and precise; avoid narrative or storytelling.

#### 2. Configuration Section
- Populate by extracting all "magic numbers", strings, options, and filenames into constants.

#### 3. Process/Analysis Logic
- **Linear Code Rule**: Write strictly linear code using Tidyverse style; do not use functions, loops (for, while), or control structures (if, else).
- **File-based Modularity**: The script reads input files and writes exactly one output file (CSV, JSON, or GPKG).
- **Comment every single line of code in Spanish**.

### Naming Conventions

#### R Packages
- All lowercase, no underscores, dots, or CamelCase (e.g., `seabirdtracking`, `cameradata`, `maritimeinformatics`).

#### Code Files (Scripts)
- The name must start with a verb.
- Only letters and numbers allowed (no ñ or accented vowels).
- The name must match the variable in the `Makefile` that defines the result set.
    - *Example*: A program generating results defined by `png_density_maps_albatross_guadalupe` should be named `render_density_maps_albatross_guadalupe`. The format (PNG) is omitted if the same script generates multiple formats (e.g., SHP).

#### Functions and Methods
- **In-Memory (No Side Effects)**:
    - `compute_*()`: Calculations in memory, returns result.
    - `plot_*()`: Generates visualization in memory.
    - `get_`: Use only if a complementary `set_` exists; otherwise, use `compute_`.
    - `input2output`: Format change (e.g., `csv2df`, `lbs2kg`).
    - `is_`: Returns logical values (e.g., `is_dog()`).
    - Each function must perform a single action. `create_*()` and `render_*()` are controlled exceptions to this rule.
- **Disk (Persistence)**:
    - `read_*()` / `write_*()`: Native formats (e.g., `.rds`).
    - `import_*()` / `export_*()`: Interoperable formats (e.g., `.csv`, `.gpkg`).
- **Writing Results**:
    - `create_*()`: Computes (`compute_*`) and writes to disk (`write_*` or `export_*`).
    - `render_*()`: Reads from disk, produces plot (`plot_*`), and writes to image.

#### Variables in the Makefile
Variable names that define sets of files consist of five elements: **format**, **variable(s)**, **monitoring type** (or result type), **species** (or group), and **geographic region**.
- Examples: `xlsx_nests_census_albatross_guadalupe`, `png_density_maps_albatross_guadalupe`.
- Redundant words already present in the repository name may be omitted.

#### Phony Targets
- Names must be nouns or adjectives.
- If the noun is omitted, the adjective is assumed to refer to the repository.

### Other Files and Directories
- Prefer [_snake_case_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).
- Only letters and numbers are allowed (no ñ or accented vowels).
- If a filename includes a date, use `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYYMMDD`. Prefer placing the date at the beginning.

#### Variables
- Use English, descriptive, and fully spelled out (no abbreviations unless allowed).
- **Prefixes**: `n_` (counts), `i_` (iteration), `is_` (boolean), `ind_` (index).
- **Suffixes**: Indicate units separated by underscore (e.g., `distance_m`, `weight_kg`, `time_s`).

### Allowed Abbreviations
- `sst`: Sea Surface Temperature
- `eez`: Exclusive Economic Zone
- `x` / `y`: UTM zonal/meridional coordinate vector
- `X` / `Y`: UTM coordinate grid
- `lon` / `lat`: Geographic zonal/meridional coordinate vector
- `LON` / `LAT`: Geographic coordinate grid

---

## Consistency & Maintenance
- Ensure absolute consistency between code, documentation, and outputs.
- Proactively remove dead code, unused scripts, and obsolete configurations.
- Keep terminology uniform across the entire project.
